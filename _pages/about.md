My name is Sen Yuan. I am currently a PhD student in microwave sensing signals and systems with the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, a group within the Department of Microelectronics. My PhD topics are related to millimeter radar signal processing in automotive applications. Before I joint this PhD, I worked on SAR, including its satellite orbits, system design, and ground processing.
