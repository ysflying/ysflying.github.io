My name is Sen Yuan. I am currently a PostDoctor researcher in microwave sensing signals and systems with the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, a group within the Department of Microelectronics. My PhD topics are related to millimeter radar signal processing in automotive applications. Before I joint this PhD, I worked on SAR, including its satellite orbits, system design, and ground processing. My phd thesis is about 3D motion-based high-resolution imaging techniques for automotive radar https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:24b76740-a92f-4d77-9875-6bda6e7aee1c
